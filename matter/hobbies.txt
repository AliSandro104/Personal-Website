                Outside of work and school, I am huge fan of football (soccer). I used to play on a local team when I was younger, but now that I have other 
                priorities, I only play casually with my brothers and friends during the summer. However, this does not prevent me from watching 
                the football games between the biggest clubs in Europe such as Real Madrid and Barcelona whenever I am free. On a daily basis, I follow
                football news around the world through social media.

            <p class="p_text">
                I don't play games often but whenever I feel like relaxing and changing my daily routine, I dive into the world of Witcher 3 as Geralt of Rivia. Until now,
                I have never found a better RPG game in terms of the plot, the freedom given to the player and the thrills, despite the game releasing seven years ago. 
                Speaking of which, an upgraded version of the game will be releasing soon.

            <p class="p_text">
                If I am looking for a multiplayer game to play with my brothers, FIFA is the way to go not only because I love football but also because it creates a healthy rivalry 
                between us when playing against each other.

                I am not the type of person that gets hooked easily on TV shows and movies, so it is hard to convince me to start watching something. Yet, when I had a lot of free time 
                during my teenagehood, I remember that watching the mainstream animes such as Dragon ball Z, Naruto and One Piece did not disappoint. Since then, I do watch anime once in a while,
                including One Piece that is still ongoing.
