                Currently, I am entering the final year of my major in computer science at McGill. <br> During the past three years, 
                I worked hard to get a solid base in computer science that will surely help me in a web development position. 
                For instance, I learned the mainstream programming languages such as Python, Java, C and Javascript, the core data structures and algorithms, 
                software design patterns and finally the basics of unit testing which are all useful both on the server side and on the client side.

                From January 2022 to August 2022, I took part in an internship where I was a web developer at Groupe Technologie Desjardins Inc. The main takeaway for me 
                during my time there was working in an agile team where I had the opportunity to interact with senior developers, analysts, tech leads and 
                a scrum master. In fact, I was able to see how the work is divided among the different members of the team and how the project was supervised. In terms of tools,
                I learned how to develop with Angular (frontend) and Java (backend), how to test APIs using Postman and how to write proper unit tests.
